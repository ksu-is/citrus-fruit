This is a project is a calorie tracker. The application will use a variety of factors to determine your caloric needs and how many calories you need in order to lose, maintain, or gain weight. Some of the factors include:
1. Height
2. Weight
3. Gender
4. Age
5. Activity Level

Once those factors have been determined, your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) will be calculated using the Harris-Benedict equation. This number will be multiplied by your activity level to create your maintenance calorie level. The app will then calculate the amount of calories needed in order to create your desired weight effect. The app will also allow you to enter in foods to change the amount of calories taken in, in a given day. This is a solo project. The two code sources that I will be looking at for guidance are as follows.
